{"body":"# AxeJS\r\n\r\nEasy HTML5+JS UI, AJAX navigation and social networks integration, published as jQuery Plugin. For some things modern browser is required, old IE (below IE8) isn't supported and never will.\r\n\r\n## Info\r\n\r\nIt enables **deep linking** engine, so server-side scripts should check if it's XmlHttpRequest to response with full page or just it's contents.\r\n\r\nThe extended plugin contains **logged user** checks and some more features for editing (like buttons) and admin menus on the website. Also, logged in users get more debug information and warnings displayed directly when something goes wrong. Backend development can be done by any engine, you'll just use simple API here.\r\n\r\nAlso, **jPlayer** may be integrated into website, extended with Playlist plugin. Combined with AJAX navigation, music can be played during reading pages (we use it for media and band's websites).\r\n\r\n## Release Details\r\n\r\nIt's created by [Annexare Studio](http://annexare.com/) for own purposes and now becomes public.\r\nTo be released January 2013, check out details later on **axejs.com**.","note":"Don't delete this file!
